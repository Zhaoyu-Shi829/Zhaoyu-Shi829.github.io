Tjena folks! Thanks for your either 'Determistic' or 'Stocastic' visits today ðŸš€. I am Jackie (my mandarin name is Zhaoyu, be creative to pronounce ðŸ˜‰). I came from a "small" city Datong in China -- in the sense of ecnomic influence. I haven been working on Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) for almost all my academic life so far. It all starts from   obtained my doctoral degree
