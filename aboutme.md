title: Me - A reformed Fluid Dynamicist
---

Tjena folks! Thanks for your either 'Determistic' or 'Stocastic' visits today ðŸš€. I am Jackie (my mandarin name is Zhaoyu, be creative to pronounce ðŸ˜‰). I came from a "small" city Datong in China -- in the sense of economic influence. I have been working on Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) for almost all my academic life so far. It all started from a glimpse of the [gallery of fluid motion](https://gfm.aps.org/) when I was a naive batchelor student in uni trying to figure out what I was gonna do in the future. I was facinated. Later I obtained my doctoral degree at NTNU.


### My journey

To be honest, I'm having some trouble remembering right now, so why don't you just watch [my movie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Princess_Bride_%28film%29) and it will answer **all** your questions.
