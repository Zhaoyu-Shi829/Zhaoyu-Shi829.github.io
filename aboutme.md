title: Me - A reformed Fluid Dynamicist

### My passion for physics will never fade away

Hello folks! Thanks for your 'Deterministic' or 'Stochastic' visits today ðŸš€. I am Jackie (my Mandarin name is Zhaoyu, be creative to pronounce ðŸ˜‰). I came from a "small" city Datong in China -- in the sense of economic influence. I have been working on Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) for almost all my academic life so far. It all started from a glimpse of the [gallery of fluid motion](https://gfm.aps.org/) when I was a naive bachelor student in uni trying to figure out what I was gonna do in the future. At the time, I was simply fascinated by the fact that a computer could mimic the real-life flow to such a high-level (reminds me of how AI has been evolved over the past exciting years). Later I obtained my doctoral degree at NTNU.


To be honest, I'm having some trouble remembering right now, so why don't you just watch [my movie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Princess_Bride_%28film%29) and it will answer **all** your questions.
