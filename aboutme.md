### My passion for fluid dynamics

Hello folks! Thanks for your 'Deterministic' or 'Stochastic' visits today ðŸš€. I am Jackie (my Mandarin name is Zhaoyu, be creative to pronounce ðŸ˜‰). I came from a "small" city Datong in China -- in the sense of economic influence. I have been working on Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) for almost all my academic life so far. It all started from a glimpse of the [gallery of fluid motion](https://gfm.aps.org/) when I was a naive mechnical engineering student trying to figure out what I was gonna do in the future. At the time, I was simply fascinated by the fact that a computer could mimic the real-life flow to such a high-level (reminds me of how AI, more precisely machine learning, has been evolved over the past exciting years). 

Of course, behind-the-scenes is always more complex and less romantic as the flow visualizations could effortlessly present themselves elegant and beaufiful, as the nature of the non-linear fluid physics defines the way it is :magic_wand:. Until I started to use A simple flow past acylinder requires different methods to solve the pressure field, velocity field, especially the tricky area around the cylinder boudaries. After years of solid study on the fluid  by coupling with Turbulence, partial differential equations, Fluid dynamics, I startedI obtained my doctoral degree at NTNU.
